### Report Grade (43.25/50) 

#### TA Feedback 

Technical Approach: MCTS + UCT with clever optimization in better_random_agent for simulations
Motivation for Technical Approach: choice of approach strengthened by explanation of game mechanics  
Pros/cons of Chosen Approach: pros and cons correctly identified and explained concisely, but lacking depth
Future Improvements: machine learning approach explained correctly, opponent moddeling is a good point, could be developed further
Language and Writing: technical explanations concise and made very easy to follow by natural prose.
Organization: very clear and well presented organization of report information
